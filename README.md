## Motivation

My team has decided to implement this project because we want to know a website how to sell its phone. On the other hand, we want to learn more about TypeScript in Frontend and Java Spring Boot in Backend. We want to make a web application that can help people to buy their own phones.

## Installation

First time you see this repository, you must clone it and then run the following command:

### `npm install`

Moreover, you should have a backend which is running with ExpressJS and NodeJS. You should also have your database to run successfully.

After all the configuration, you can run the following command:

### `npm run dev`

And... That's all what you need.

## Requirements

- **nodejs >=14**
